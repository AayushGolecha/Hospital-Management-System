 their skin, mucous membranes, hair and nails. Mayo Clinic's skin specialists (dermatologists and dermatopathologists) diagnose and treat <br>
hundreds of conditions, including many that are rare or complex. They work closely with you and your health care team to understand and <br>
address your dermatologic needs and give you the right answers the first time.</p>

 health and surgery. They also perform Mohs micrographic surgery, laser surgery, cosmetic surgery and other dermatologic surgical procedures.</p>
