        <b><u>About the Neurology Department</u></b>
    </p>
    <p>Fortis top-ranked team of neurologists diagnoses and treats more than 100,000 adults and children each year,
        including those with complex or rare conditions.</p>

    <p>The Fortis Department of Neurology is one of the largest and most comprehensive neurological practices in the
        world. It includes more than 200 subspecialized experts trained in epilepsy, movement disorders, dementias and
        other cognitive conditions, stroke and cerebrovascular diseases, neuro-oncology, multiple sclerosis and
        demyelinating disorders, autoimmune neurology, pediatric neurology, neurophysiology, headache, neuromuscular
        diseases, peripheral nerve, sleep neurology, and speech pathology.</p>

    <p><b>The right care the first time</b></p>

        study, 88 percent of people who came to Mayo Clinic for a second opinion received a new or refined diagnosis.
    </p>
    <p>You may undergo several tests so that your doctors can identify exactly what's causing your signs and symptoms.
        Fortis neurologists and neurosurgeons work with radiologists who use innovative and advanced imaging
        technologies and tools, including 7-Tesla MRI, magnetic resonance elastography, PET imaging and molecular
        diagnostics.
